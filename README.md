# [Box Annotations](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048016153-Annotating-Documents)

Box Annotations allows users to add markup on top of content displayed by [Box Content Preview](https://developer.box.com/docs/box-content-preview). Annotations improve collaboration by allowing users to draw attention and leave specific feedback on specific areas of a document or image. The library currently supports several [annotation types](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059971834-Document-and-Image-Files-You-Can-Annotate) which can vary based on the type of file being previewed.
